# Kit Tailwind

The Kit Tailwind extension parses your hiccup source to extract tailwind classes before running tailwind.

## Usage

```bash
npm i
npm run tailwind:extract-classes path/to/views # run tailwindcss in a separate step
npm run tailwind:watch path/to/views # runs tailwindcss automatically
```

Organize your view generating code within a single parent directory to reduce the number of files that must be scanned.
